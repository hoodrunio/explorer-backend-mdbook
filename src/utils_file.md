# Utils File

[`utils.rs`](https://github.com/testnetrunn/explorer-backend/blob/main/src/utils.rs) file contains the definitions of utility functions.

There are some functions undone.

For example [`convert_consensus_pubkey_to_consensus_address`](https://github.com/testnetrunn/explorer-backend/blob/main/src/utils.rs#L100) is not completed.

There is a note to complete it:

> Take the address from the pubkey and bech32 encode it using the correct HRP prefix
